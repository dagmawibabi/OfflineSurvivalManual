> A MultiTool can be useful in everyday life – not only in survival situations.

## What does a MultiTool provide?

A MultiTool can provide a lot of tools – hence the name. There are different options available. It is always a tradeoff between weight/size and the amount/set of tools.
The commonly available tools in a typical MultiTool are:

* Knife
* Can-Opener / Corkscrew
* Screwdriver
* Pliers / Tweezers
* Wire-Cutter
* Wood-Saw
* ...

But there are also special tools like: bit-drivers, whistle, scissors, Ferrocerium Rod to spark a fire, Sharpener, ...

If you use a MultiTool in everyday life, then you will know how to use it in a survival situation. The seconds you are faster and the confidence you have in your tool can decide between life and death.

## Which MultiTool should I use?

### Leatherman

There are a lot of options out there. I really like my [Leatherman OHT](OHTMultiTool).
I am carrying it most of the time when going out.

I leave my Leatherman OHT at home when I want to go dance and jump around or have to go to a place with security that might have a problem with the tool as it contains a sharp knife. At some point, I might buy a [Tread Bracelet MultiTool](TreadMultiTool) for these cases.

Also, I like the story behind the company. There is a nice video with the [inventor on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwyIF4VBTk). He wanted this tool and persisted in a very humble way. He is also proudly showing the durability in this video – really worth a look if you still have internet ;-)

### Victorinox

Another option is Victorinox, the Swiss provider of the Swiss Army Knife (along with being a Swiss-owned Wenger company). 

With less diversity in the model shapes – two in fact, straight or ergonomic. Victorinox offers a serious selection of embeddable tools. One recommendation is the SwissTool Spirit (the ergonomic one).

Alternatively, there are credit card-sized MultiTools called _Swiss Cards_. These have many of the tools that their larger MultiTools have, but are lighter and can fit in your wallet.
