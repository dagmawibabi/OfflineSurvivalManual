> This section will give you some information regarding this application, but **if you are in a survival situation right now** - please **skip this blurb** and jump directly to the section that contains the information you need.

This app is intended to guide you in rough times, but it can also be used to have fun outdoors and to learn things that are useful to know in case of an emergency. The fun parts can also be used to train important skills for potential survival situations. Remember, reading is only one factor - practice and understanding are also needed to increase your skillset and improve your chances of survival.

> I, Dagmawi Babi, genuinely think prayer is important to survive and get through horrific situations. And so here's a simple verse...
**"Jacob, the Lord created you. Israel, he made you, and now he says, “Don’t be afraid. I saved you. I named you. You are mine. When you have troubles, I am with you. When you cross rivers, you will not be hurt. When you walk through fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not hurt you. That’s because I, the Lord, am your God. I, the Holy One of Israel, am your Savior. I gave Egypt to pay for you. I gave Ethiopia and Seba to make you mine. You are precious to me, and I have given you a special place of honor. I love you. That’s why I am willing to trade others, to give up whole nations, to save your life."** — Isaiah 43:1-4
