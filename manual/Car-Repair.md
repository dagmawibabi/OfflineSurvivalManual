Jump Starting

 Jump-starting a car is a relatively simple procedure that can get you back on the road quickly. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to safely jump start a car.

What You'll Need

Before you begin, gather the following items:

Jumper cables
Another vehicle with a working battery
Safety gloves and eye protection are recommended.

Step 1: Park the Cars Close Together

Position the working vehicle and the dead car so that they are close but not touching. Turn off the ignition in both vehicles and put them in "Park" or "Neutral" (for manual transmissions).

Step 2: Locate the Batteries

Open the hoods of both cars and locate the batteries. You'll see two battery terminals on each battery: one positive (+) and one negative (-). They are typically red for positive and black for negative.

Step 3: Attach the Jumper Cables

Here's the sequence to follow when attaching the jumper cables:

Start with the red (positive) jumper cable. Attach one end to the positive terminal of the dead battery.
Attach the other end of the red cable to the positive terminal of the working battery.
Now, take the black (negative) jumper cable and attach one end to the negative terminal of the working battery.
Attach the remaining end of the black cable to an unpainted metal surface under the hood of the dead car. This can be a bolt or bracket. Do not attach it to the negative terminal of the dead battery, as this can create a spark.
Step 4: Start the Working Vehicle

Start the vehicle with the good battery and let it run for a few minutes. This will help charge the dead battery in the other car.

Step 5: Attempt to Start the Dead Car

After a few minutes, try to start the car with the dead battery. If it doesn't start on the first try, wait a minute or two and try again. If it still doesn't start after a few attempts, you may have a more serious issue, and it's best to seek professional assistance.

Step 6: Remove the Jumper Cables

Once the dead car is running, carefully remove the jumper cables in the reverse order you attached them:

Remove the black cable from the previously dead car's unpainted metal surface.
Remove the black cable from the working car's negative terminal.
Remove the red cable from the working car's positive terminal.
Finally, remove the red cable from the dead car's positive terminal.
Step 7: Drive the Revived Car

Leave the previously dead car running for at least 15 minutes to ensure the battery is sufficiently charged. Then, you're ready to hit the road.
