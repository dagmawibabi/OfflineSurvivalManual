*Q: Can you make this app work with the ultra power saving mode on Samsung devices?*

A: It does not seem to be possible. As far as I was able to find out – apps have to be white-listed from Samsung. I have found no option to do this from the app-side. Would love to be able to do this – but it does not seem to be possible. If you know a way please let me know! Also if someone has contact with vendors like Samsung – I also would love if this app gets preinstalled on new phones.

*Q: I found a typo – do I have to live with it?*

A: No – you are very invited to fix the typo or contribute other enhancements to the content via [the wiki](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual/wiki).

*Q: Can we please have translations?*

A: Yes – but it's complicated. You can read about this [here](TranslatorNotes). That said I will start with partial translation support ( some sections and in-app translations ) soon and there are already a lot of translators standing by already ( thanks a lot for this ). But first, the current content has to be improved more. It would be a great help if people could break up the images with lists into markdown which is easier to translate and needs less space.

*Q: It says offline – why does it still need internet permission?*

A: The premise of “offline” here is that the app will work without the internet in survival situations – but might still use the internet if it is available. If you do not want this you can still put your phone e.g. in airplane mode.

*Q: Can you please not express any political opinions in this app?*

A: No – I am not keeping my mouth shut for you – if you cannot take other opinions you should think about your own – maybe they are so fragile that you are afraid of others.
